## 📋 CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Login/Signup Button with User Menu

**File:** `src/components/Header.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added imports for `useAuth` hook and Firebase `signOut`
- Added `LogOut` and `User` icons from lucide-react
- Created user dropdown menu that shows when logged in
- Implemented authentication state detection using `useAuth()` hook

**Features Added:**
```javascript
✅ When NOT logged in:
   - Shows "Login/Signup" button (existing)
   
✅ When logged in:
   - Shows "Signed in as [Name/Email]" button
   - Dropdown menu displays:
     * User email & display name
     * Quick link to Dashboard
     * Quick link to Profile
     * Sign Out button (with logout handler)
     
✅ Loading state:
   - Shows animated skeleton while auth state loads
```

**User Experience:**
- User dropdown appears on header right side
- Click user button to toggle dropdown
- "Dashboard" link: Quick access to main dashboard
- "Profile" link: Quick access to profile page
- "Sign Out" button: Safe logout with Firebase signOut

### 2. ✅ Secured Dashboard Pages Behind Authentication

**File:** `src/App.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Created new `ProtectedRoute.jsx` component for authentication-protected routes
- Imported and integrated `ProtectedRoute` into App.jsx
- Wrapped all dashboard pages with `<ProtectedRoute>` component

**Protected Routes:**
```
Dashboard pages (registered users only):
✅ /dashboard - Main dashboard
✅ /profile - User profile
✅ /lifecv - LifeCV profile
✅ /contacts - Contacts management
✅ /calendar - Calendar & scheduling
✅ /assets - Asset management
✅ /projects - Projects management
✅ /career-paths - Career management
✅ /family - Family information
✅ /family-timeline - Family timeline

Guest-accessible routes (unchanged):
- /home - Home page
- /solo - Solo experience
- /instant-trust - Instant trust verification
- (All public pages still accessible to guests)
```

**ProtectedRoute Behavior:**
```javascript
✅ If user IS authenticated:
   - Component renders normally
   
✅ If user is NOT authenticated:
   - Redirects to /onboarding
   - Shows onboarding/auth page
   
✅ If authentication is loading:
   - Shows LoadingSpinner
```

**File:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` (New)

### 3. ✅ Fixed Dashboard Layout Overlap Issues

**File:** `src/components/Dashboard.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Increased spacing between categories: `space-y-4` → `space-y-6`
- Increased padding-bottom for categories: `pb-4` → `pb-6`
- Fixed spacing in expanded content: `space-y-1` → `space-y-2` (with consistent `mt-3`)
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to icons to prevent shrinking in flexbox
- Fixed last category `last:border-b-0` to remove bottom border

**Result:**
```
BEFORE: Categories overlapped when expanded
├─ Personal section expanded
├─ Text from Personal overlapped with Family section below
└─ Difficult to read overlapping content

AFTER: Clean separated sections
├─ Personal section expanded with proper spacing
├─ Clear 6px (space-y-6) gap between sections
├─ No overlapping text
└─ Professional section appears below with proper distance
```

**CSS Changes Summary:**
```tailwind
# Category container spacing
- space-y-4  → space-y-6     (+50% more vertical space)
- pb-4       → pb-6           (+50% more bottom padding)

# Expanded items spacing
- mt-2       → mt-3           (+33% more top margin)
- space-y-1  → space-y-2      (+100% more item spacing)

# Icon handling
- Added flex-shrink-0 to prevent icon squashing
```
