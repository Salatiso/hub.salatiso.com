# ✅ Java PATH Configuration Complete

**Status:** ✅ Java PATH Added Permanently  
**Java Version:** 1.8.0_471  
**Installation Path:** C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_471  

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### Problem
```
Error: Could not spawn `java -version`. Please make sure Java is installed and on your system PATH.
```

**Root Cause:** Java was installed but not added to system PATH environment variable.

### Solution
Added Java bin directory to Windows system PATH:
```
C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_471\bin
```

**Now added to:**
- User environment variables (permanent)
- System PATH
- Current session

---

## ✅ Verification

Java is now accessible from any terminal:
```powershell
java -version
# Output: java version "1.8.0_471"
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Current PowerShell Session

If you're still in the same PowerShell terminal, Java may not be recognized yet. 

**Option 1: Use this command in your current terminal (already configured)**
```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_471\bin"
firebase emulators:start
```

**Option 2: Restart PowerShell**
Close and reopen PowerShell, then:
```powershell
firebase emulators:start
```

**Option 3: Test in your current terminal** (recommended)
```powershell
java -version
```

If it shows Java version, you're good to go!
