## Troubleshooting

### Google Sign-In Opens Popup But Nothing Happens
- Browser may have blocked popup
- Try: Allow popups for lifesync-lifecv.web.app
- Or use Email/Password login instead

### "Missing or insufficient permissions" Error
- âœ… **FIXED** - This shouldn't appear anymore
- Refresh page if you see this
- Report if still occurring

### Can't See Dashboard After Login
- Check console for errors
- Try clearing browser cache
- Try incognito/private window

### Theme Not Persisting
- Check browser allows localStorage
- Try different browser
- Report if issue persists
