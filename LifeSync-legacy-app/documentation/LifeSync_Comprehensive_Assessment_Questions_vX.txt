**III. User-Generated Questions (UGQs)**
* **Functionality:** Users can create their own questions and provide their own answers.
* **Purpose:** To cover nuances not addressed in the standard assessments.
* **Sharing:** Users control which of their UGQs are visible to a synced partner. A partner can then choose to answer the same question if they see it.
* **Verification (Light):** The system might offer a suggestion if a user's UGQ is very similar to an existing platform question, to encourage using standard questions for broader compatibility insights, but ultimately allow the user to proceed.

**IV. Scoring & Feedback Integration**
* **Cumulative Feedback:** For guest/temporary users and registered users, feedback (e.g., "Initial alignment on X: Moderate") can be provided as they fill out their core profile and initial assessments[cite: 142].
* **Sectional & Global Scores:** Calculated based on responses to structured questions in the detailed assessments for registered users[cite: 141].
* **Profile data:** While not directly "scored" in the same way as assessments, comprehensive profile data (hobbies, work, etc.) will be crucial for users to review side-by-side with a synced partner for perceived compatibility and conversation starters. The system can highlight shared interests or stark differences from this profile data.
