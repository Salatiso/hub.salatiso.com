→ Did you wait 5 minutes for Firebase to update?
→ Did you hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)?

### "Google sign-in page doesn't open"
→ Check console errors (F12)
→ Did you add all redirect URIs in Google Cloud?
→ Try incognito/private window

### "Profile not showing after sign-in"
→ Check console errors (F12)
→ Did the sign-in redirect back to LifeSync?
