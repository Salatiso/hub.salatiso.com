## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Fixed Sidebar Layout
**Decision:** Use fixed positioning (not flexbox)
**Rationale:** Better performance, always accessible, standard pattern
**Result:** 288px wide sidebar always visible on desktop, drawer on mobile

### 2. Context-Aware Routing
**Decision:** Use query parameters (?context=family)
**Rationale:** Reuse components, bookmarkable, cleaner code
**Result:** Same Calendar/Assets/Projects components work for all contexts

### 3. localStorage Persistence
**Decision:** Persist expanded sections to localStorage
**Rationale:** Respects user preferences, survives reload, lightweight
**Result:** Users' sidebar state restored on app restart

### 4. Mobile Drawer Pattern
**Decision:** Hamburger menu + off-canvas drawer
**Rationale:** Standard pattern, maximizes mobile space, accessible
**Result:** Responsive at all breakpoints (320px - 4K+)

### 5. TypeScript Throughout
**Decision:** 100% TypeScript coverage (no any types)
**Rationale:** Type safety, better IDE support, easier refactoring
**Result:** Zero TypeScript errors, fully type-safe codebase

## 🎓 Architecture Patterns Used

### Component Composition
- Small, focused components (single responsibility)
- Proper prop types with TypeScript
- Memoization where needed
- Proper cleanup (event listeners)

### State Management
- Hook-based state (useNavigation)
- localStorage for persistence
- Route-aware updates (useLocation)
- Media query hook for responsive

### Accessibility-First
- Semantic HTML as foundation
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation built-in
- Focus management throughout

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint at 1024px
- Tailwind CSS utilities
- CSS media queries for drawer
