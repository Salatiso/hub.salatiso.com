## 💬 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why does the local account use a PIN instead of password?**
A: PIN is faster (4 digits, no complexity rules) and perfect for initial signup. Users can upgrade to full password later.

**Q: Why is Phase 2 hashing PIN?**
A: Phase 1 focuses on speed and entry. Phase 2 will add PBKDF2 hashing for security when connecting to backend sync.

**Q: Can users change their PIN after signup?**
A: Not yet (Phase 2 feature). Currently only modifiable by clearing localStorage and re-signup.

**Q: What if users forget their PIN?**
A: localStorage is persistent until cleared. No "forgot PIN" yet (Phase 2 feature for account recovery).

**Q: Why three options instead of just one?**
A: Different users have different preferences. Google for convenience, Email for control, Local for offline-first.
