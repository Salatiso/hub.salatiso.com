## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Current Status
| Security Area | Implementation | Phase 2 Plan |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| PIN Storage | Plaintext in localStorage | PBKDF2 hashing |
| Password Storage | Plaintext in localStorage | PBKDF2 hashing |
| OAuth Scopes | profile, email (minimal) | Maintain current |
| API Keys | Not exposed in client | Maintain current |
| Form Validation | Working (PIN 4 digits, password 8+) | Add strength meter |
| HTTPS | Required for OAuth | Enforce on deploy |

### Risk Assessment
- **PIN plaintext storage**: LOW risk (Phase 1 acceptable, fixed Phase 2)
- **No OAuth attack vectors**: NONE identified
- **Form validation gaps**: NONE identified
- **XSS vulnerabilities**: NONE (React escapes, Tailwind sanitized)
- **CSRF tokens**: Not needed (Firebase auth handles)
