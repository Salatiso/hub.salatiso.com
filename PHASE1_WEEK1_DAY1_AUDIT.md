## 🎯 Key Questions to Answer Today

### Architecture Questions
1. How many dashboard components need keyboard updates?
2. What's the hierarchy of focus?
3. Which components need focus traps (modals)?
4. Where should global shortcuts be registered?

### Implementation Questions
5. Should each component manage its own keyboard, or use global handler?
6. How to handle focus restoration after modals close?
7. How to prevent keyboard conflicts?
8. How to test keyboard accessibility at scale?

### Documentation Questions
9. What keyboard patterns will we standardize?
10. How will developers know what keyboard support to implement?
11. What testing is required for keyboard features?

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Plan

### System Design: Global Keyboard Manager

```typescript
// Architecture Overview

1. Global Keyboard Context
   - Central keyboard state
   - Shortcut registry
   - Focus stack management
   
2. Keyboard Hooks
   - useKeyboardShortcuts(shortcuts: Shortcut[])
   - useFocusManagement(config: FocusConfig)
   - useKeyboardNavigation(items: NavigationItem[])
   
3. Keyboard Utilities
   - parseKeyEvent(event: KeyboardEvent)
   - matchesShortcut(event, shortcut)
   - manageFocus(target, direction)
   
4. Component Implementation
   - Components use hooks
   - Hooks use utilities
   - Context provides state
```

### Hook Architecture

```
useKeyboardShortcuts
  └─ useCallback(handleKeyDown)
     └─ Keyboard Context (check registry)
        └─ Execute handler

useFocusManagement
  └─ useEffect (setup)
     └─ FocusStack
        └─ Restore focus on unmount

useKeyboardNavigation
  └─ useRef (focusable elements)
     └─ useCallback(navigate)
        └─ useEffect (arrow keys)
```
