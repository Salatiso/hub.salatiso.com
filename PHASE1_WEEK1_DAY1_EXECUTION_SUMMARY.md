## 📋 What Was Completed Today

### 1. ✅ Component Audit (COMPLETE)
**File Created:** `PHASE1_WEEK1_DAY1_AUDIT_RESULTS.md`

**Findings:**
- 🔍 Analyzed Dashboard.jsx (460 lines)
- 🔍 Analyzed FloatingToolbar.jsx (305 lines)
- 🔍 Identified 40+ dashboard components

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue with Infrastructure (RECOMMENDED)
Start Day 2 (Oct 27) - Create keyboard infrastructure files

**Timeline:**
- Day 2: keyboard.types.ts, keyboardUtils.ts, KeyboardContext.tsx
- Day 3: useKeyboardShortcuts.ts, useFocusManagement.ts, useKeyboardNavigation.ts
- Both days: ESLint validation, type checking, testing

**Result:** 6 production-ready files, 1000+ lines, ready for FloatingToolbar

### Option 2: Review & Refine
Before proceeding, review the infrastructure plan and provide feedback

**What to review:**
- Do the TypeScript interfaces make sense?
- Are the utility functions comprehensive?
- Is the hook API intuitive?
- Any changes to architecture?
