## 🚀 Testing the Authentication Flow

### Step-by-Step Test

1. **Open Dev Server**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Observe Dashboard Loads**
   - Check for loading spinner
   - All widgets should render
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Should see ✅ no 503 errors

3. **Test Google Sign-In**
   - Locate "Sign In" button (likely in navbar or widget)
   - Click "Sign In with Google"
   - Google popup should appear (no timeout/error)
   - Enter your Google credentials
   - Should successfully sign in (or fail gracefully if not configured)

4. **Check Network Tab**
   - Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
   - Clear all requests
   - Click Sign In again
   - **Should see:**
     - `identitytoolkit.googleapis.com` → Status 200 ✅
     - `accounts.google.com` → Google auth flow
     - **Should NOT see:** `maps.googleapis.com` with 503 error
   - All requests should complete successfully

5. **Verify Console**
   - Open DevTools → Console tab
   - Should see NO errors
   - Should see NO auth/network-request-failed messages
   - May see info messages about lazy loading (that's expected)
