## 🎯 PHASE 2: WHAT WE'RE BUILDING NOW

### Mission
**Close the gap between sidebar items and working pages**

### Missing Pages (9 total)
```
HIGH PRIORITY (Build First):
  1. Profile page (/profile)              - User profile management
  2. LifeCV page (/lifecv)                - LifeCV profile data
  3. Contacts page (/contacts)            - Contact management

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
  4. Calendar page (/calendar)            - Event scheduling
  5. Assets page (/assets)                - Resource management
  6. Projects page (/projects)            - Project management
  7. Family page (/family)                - Family features

LOW PRIORITY:
  8. Career Paths page (/career-paths)    - Career development
  9. Family Timeline (/family/timeline)   - Timeline view
```

### How It Works
```
Before Phase 2:                  After Phase 2:
Sidebar → Click → 404 Error      Sidebar → Click → Working Page
Browser URL → 404                Browser URL → Working Page
9 missing pages                  9 working pages
```

## 🚀 THREE WAYS TO PROCEED

### Option A: Build Everything Now ⚡
```
Time: ~2 hours
Result: All 9 pages complete
Benefit: Everything done fast
Best for: Get it all done ASAP
```

### Option B: High Priority First 🎯
```
Time: ~1 hour (Phase 2.1)
