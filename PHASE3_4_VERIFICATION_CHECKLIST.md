## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING DURING TESTING

### If Widget Shows "Loading..."
```
1. ☐ Wait 5 seconds (data may still be loading)
2. ☐ Check Firebase Console - is the data there?
3. ☐ Refresh page: Ctrl+R
4. ☐ Check console for error messages
5. ☐ If error: Fix the issue, reload, retry
```

### If Console Shows RED Error
```
1. ☐ Note the exact error message

4. ☐ Fix the issue
5. ☐ Refresh page: Ctrl+R
6. ☐ Test again
```

### If Widget Shows No Data
```

5. ☐ If no: Update rule to allow reads
6. ☐ Refresh page and retry
```
