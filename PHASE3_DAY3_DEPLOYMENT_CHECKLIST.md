## üß™ TESTING COMMANDS

### Test in Browser Console

```javascript
// First, import the helper
import { 
  initializeFirestoreTestData,
  verifyFirestoreCollections,
  testSecurityRules,
  runFirestoreHealthCheck 
} from './services/firestoreDeploymentHelper';

// Test 1: Initialize test data
await initializeFirestoreTestData();
// Should output: ‚úÖ All collections initialized successfully!

// Test 2: Verify collections
const results = await verifyFirestoreCollections();
// Should output: ‚úÖ All 8 collections accessible

// Test 3: Test security rules
await testSecurityRules();
// Should output: ‚úÖ All security tests passed!

// Test 4: Full health check (recommended)
await runFirestoreHealthCheck();
// Should output: ‚úÖ FIRESTORE IS READY FOR PRODUCTION!
```

### Manual Testing

```javascript
// Test collection access
import { db } from './config/firebase';
import { collection, getDocs, limit, query } from 'firebase/firestore';

const testCollection = async (name) => {
  try {
    const ref = collection(db, name);
    const q = query(ref, limit(1));
    const snap = await getDocs(q);
    console.log(`‚úÖ ${name}: ${snap.size} document(s)`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`‚ùå ${name}: ${err.message}`);
  }
};

// Test all collections
await testCollection('users');
await testCollection('profiles');
await testCollection('verifications');
// ... etc for all 8
```

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Permission denied" accessing Firestore

**Cause:** Security rules not deployed or not propagated yet  
**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for rules to propagate
2. Check rules show "Published" with green checkmark
3. Refresh browser page
4. Try again

### Issue: Collections don't appear in list

**Cause:** Collections not created or named incorrectly  
**Solution:**
1. Check spelling (case-sensitive!)
2. In Firebase console, click "Start collection" manually
3. Create collection with exact name: `users`, `profiles`, etc.

### Issue: Indexes stuck on "Building"

**Cause:** Normal behavior, just takes time  
**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes
2. Refresh page
3. Check back in 10-15 minutes
4. If stuck >30 min, delete and recreate

### Issue: Test shows "security rules not found"

**Cause:** Rules not published yet  
**Solution:**
1. Go to Firestore ‚Üí Rules tab
2. Check status shows "Published"
3. Click Publish again if needed
4. Wait for green checkmark
5. Try test again

### Issue: Can't create documents in Firebase Console

**Cause:** Security rules preventing test document creation  
**Solution:**
1. This is expected - rules are strict
2. Use the helper script instead
3. Or temporarily modify rules to allow testing
4. Or add a service account key for admin access
