## Technical Implementation Details

### Firestore Collections Created:
1. `users/{userId}/calendar/events` - Calendar event storage
2. `users/{userId}/assets/inventory` - Asset inventory tracking
3. `users/{userId}/projects/all` - Project management

### Real-time Sync Architecture:
```
Components ←→ GuestContext ←→ Firestore
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Firebase Auth Context (useAuth hook)
```

Each component:
1. Loads data from Firestore on mount
2. Listens for real-time updates via onSnapshot()
3. Detects cross-app updates via lastUpdatedBy field
4. Updates UI immediately on changes
5. Shows sync status to user

### State Management:
- Local state for UI components
- GuestContext for app-wide data
- Firebase for persistent, synced storage
- Real-time listeners for cross-app detection

### Error Handling:
✅ Sync status tracking (idle, syncing, success, error)
✅ User feedback on sync state
✅ Graceful fallback to local storage if Firebase fails
✅ Error logging to console
✅ User-friendly error messages
