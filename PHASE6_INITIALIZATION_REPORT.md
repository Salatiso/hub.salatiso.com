MEDIUM PRIORITY:
□ FilterButton, SyncStatusIndicator, EmptyState, ErrorMessage
□ LoadingSpinner, BirthdayItem, AnniversaryItem, EventTypeFilter
□ DateRangePicker, ExportButton, Header, Sidebar, Footer, Modal, Dialog

TOTAL: 25+ components
```

**Process for Day 2:**
1. Identify each component's file location
2. Analyze if it's a pure component (props → output)
3. Wrap with `export default memo(ComponentName)`
4. Test with React DevTools Profiler
5. Run ESLint + Build verification
6. Document the change

**Expected Outcome:**
- 25+ components wrapped with memo
- 20-30% reduction in unnecessary re-renders
- ESLint: 0 errors, Build: 0 errors
- Ready for Day 3 (useCallback)

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PHASE 6

### What's Working Well
- ✅ Phase 5 foundation solid (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- ✅ Real-time Firestore sync implemented
- ✅ Analytics and reporting systems built
- ✅ Development environment stable
- ✅ Build process optimized

### What to Watch For
- ⚠️ Bundle size is 3.11 MB (2.3x target) - Route splitting will help most
- ⚠️ Main JS is 1.36 MB - React.memo and code splitting will reduce this
- ⚠️ UI bundle at 0.62 MB - Tree-shaking will help
- ⚠️ Build time at 30s - Vite optimization possible

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Days 1-5:** Focus on React performance (memo, callbacks, memos, context)
2. **Days 6-7:** Focus on code splitting and bundle analysis
3. **Days 8-9:** Focus on testing and Lighthouse optimization
4. **Day 10:** Deploy to production

---

## 💡 QUICK START FOR TOMORROW (Day 2)

**Goal:** Wrap 25+ components with React.memo

**Basic Pattern:**
```javascript
// Existing component
function StatCard({ value, label, icon: Icon }) {
  return (
    <div className="stat-card">
      <Icon className="w-5 h-5" />
      <span>{label}</span>
      <span className="text-2xl font-bold">{value}</span>
    </div>
  );
}

// Optimized with memo
export default memo(StatCard);
```

**Process:**
1. Find component file
2. Add import: `import { memo } from 'react';`
3. Wrap export: `export default memo(ComponentName);`
4. Test with React DevTools Profiler
5. Run: `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
6. Verify no errors
7. Move to next component

**Expected Time:** ~4-6 hours for 25+ components
