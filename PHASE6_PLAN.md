Lighthouse Score: ~75 (estimated)
```

### Phase 6 Target Metrics
```

```

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Strategy 1: Component Memoization**
- React.memo for pure components (25+ candidates)
- Focus: Dumb presentational components
- Benefits: Prevent unnecessary re-renders, 20-30% reduction in renders

**Strategy 2: Callback Optimization**
- useCallback for all event handlers (50+ candidates)
- useCallback for useEffect dependencies
- Benefits: Stable function references, child component optimization

**Strategy 3: Computation Memoization**
- useMemo for expensive computations (30+ candidates)
- Focus: Complex array operations, filtering, sorting, calculations
- Benefits: Avoid recalculation on re-renders

**Strategy 4: State Management**
- Context API optimization
- Reduce prop drilling
- Split contexts by concern (Auth, Guest, Notifications, etc.)
- Benefits: Cleaner component trees, easier to optimize

**Strategy 5: Code Splitting**
- Route-based splitting (each page loads separately)
- Component-based splitting (heavy components lazy-loaded)
- Vendor bundle optimization
- Benefits: 40-50% reduction in initial bundle

### Code Splitting Implementation

**Route-Based Splitting:**
```javascript
// Before: Static imports
import Family from './pages/Family';
import Calendar from './pages/Calendar';
import Assets from './pages/Assets';

// After: Dynamic imports with React.lazy()
const Family = lazy(() => import('./pages/Family'));
const Calendar = lazy(() => import('./pages/Calendar'));
const Assets = lazy(() => import('./pages/Assets'));

// Wrap with Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/family" element={<Family />} />
  </Routes>
</Suspense>
```

**Component-Based Splitting:**
```javascript
// Heavy modal components
const AnalyticsDashboard = lazy(() => import('./components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard'));
const ReportBuilder = lazy(() => import('./components/reporting/ReportBuilder'));

// Wrap in Suspense with fallback UI
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading analytics...</div>}>
  <AnalyticsDashboard />
</Suspense>
```

## 🔄 OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: React.memo with Custom Comparison

```javascript
// Before: Component re-renders on every parent re-render
function StatCard({ value, label, icon: Icon }) {
  return (
    <div className="stat-card">
      <Icon className="w-5 h-5" />
      <span>{label}</span>
      <span className="text-2xl font-bold">{value}</span>
    </div>
  );
}

// After: Only re-renders if props actually change
export default memo(StatCard, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return (
    prevProps.value === nextProps.value &&
    prevProps.label === nextProps.label &&
    prevProps.icon === nextProps.icon
  );
});
```

### Pattern 2: useCallback with Dependency Management

```javascript
// Before: Function recreated on every render
function FamilyList() {
  const handleAddMember = () => { /* ... */ };
  return <AddButton onClick={handleAddMember} />; // Child re-renders every time
}

// After: Function created once, reference stays same
function FamilyList() {
  const handleAddMember = useCallback(() => { /* ... */ }, []);
  return <AddButton onClick={handleAddMember} />; // Child only re-renders if handler changes
}
```

### Pattern 3: useMemo for Complex Calculations

```javascript
// Before: Array filtered on every render
function Timeline() {
  const filteredEvents = familyEvents
    .filter(e => e.type === filterType)
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date))
    .slice(0, 10);
  return <EventsList events={filteredEvents} />;
}

// After: Array only recalculated when dependencies change
function Timeline() {
  const filteredEvents = useMemo(() => {
    return familyEvents
      .filter(e => e.type === filterType)
      .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date))
      .slice(0, 10);
  }, [familyEvents, filterType]);
  return <EventsList events={filteredEvents} />;
}
```

### Pattern 4: Route-Based Code Splitting

```javascript
// Before: All routes loaded upfront
import Home from './pages/Home';
import Family from './pages/Family';
import Calendar from './pages/Calendar';
import Assets from './pages/Assets';

// After: Routes load on demand
const Home = lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'));
const Family = lazy(() => import('./pages/Family'));
const Calendar = lazy(() => import('./pages/Calendar'));
const Assets = lazy(() => import('./pages/Assets'));

// Route configuration
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/family" element={<Family />} />
    <Route path="/calendar" element={<Calendar />} />
    <Route path="/assets" element={<Assets />} />
  </Routes>
</Suspense>
```

### Pattern 5: Context Splitting for Optimization

```javascript
// Before: One large context, many subscribers
<AppContext.Provider value={{ user, family, events, assets, notifications }}>
  <App />
</AppContext.Provider>
// Every component subscribing to AppContext re-renders on any value change

// After: Multiple focused contexts
<AuthProvider> {/* User data */}
  <FamilyProvider> {/* Family data */}
    <EventProvider> {/* Event data */}
      <NotificationProvider> {/* Notifications */}
        <App />
      </NotificationProvider>
    </EventProvider>
  </FamilyProvider>
</AuthProvider>
// Components only subscribe to needed contexts
```

## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

### Potential Risks

**Risk 1: Memoization Overhead**
- Issue: Memoization can add overhead if not used correctly
- Mitigation: Use React DevTools profiler to verify effectiveness
- Rollback: Remove memo if causing slowdown

**Risk 2: Dependency Array Errors**
- Issue: Incorrect useCallback/useMemo dependencies can cause stale data
- Mitigation: Use eslint-plugin-react-hooks to catch errors
- Rollback: Comprehensive testing catches issues early

**Risk 3: Bundle Size Not Improving**
- Issue: Code splitting might not reduce bundle as expected
- Mitigation: Use Vite analysis to understand bundle composition
- Rollback: Remove unnecessary splitting if counterproductive

**Risk 4: Deployment Failure**
- Issue: Production build might have issues not seen in dev
- Mitigation: Test production build locally before Firebase deploy
