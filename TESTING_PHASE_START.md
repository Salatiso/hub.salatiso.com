## 🤝 How Parallel Testing Works

### I (Agent) Will:
1. **Verify automatically:**
   - Simulate keyboard events
   - Check state changes
   - Verify ARIA attributes
   - Check console for errors
   
2. **Document findings:**
   - Record which features work
   - Log any issues
   - Compare with your findings

### You (User) Will:
1. **Test manually:**
   - Use keyboard naturally
   - Check focus visible
   - Verify modals trap focus
   - Report issues found

2. **Share findings:**
   - Report what works
   - Report what doesn't
   - Provide browser/OS info

### We'll Compare:
- ✅ If both show same results → Feature confirmed working
- ⚠️ If results differ → Investigate discrepancy
- 🔧 If issues found → Fix and re-test
