## 🎓 Knowledge Base

### Understanding Phase 2

**What Was Built:**
- 9 new feature pages
- 9 new routes
- 8 sidebar menu items
- Full CRUD operations on all pages
- Data persistence
- Keyboard accessibility
- Form validation
- Error handling

**How It Works:**
1. User logs in (Firebase auth)
2. Sidebar shows navigation items
3. User clicks on a page or navigates via URL
4. RequireAuth checks authentication
5. Page loads (lazy loaded)
6. User interacts with forms
7. Data saves to GuestContext
8. GuestContext persists to localStorage/Firebase

**Data Flow:**
```
User Input → Component State → GuestContext → localStorage/Firebase
                                                         ↓
                                           (Sync to server if needed)
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Already Implemented
- ✅ Authentication gates on all pages
- ✅ No sensitive data in localStorage (only IDs/references)
- ✅ Firebase security rules configured
- ✅ Client-side validation
- ✅ HTTPS ready

### For Phase 3
- [ ] Server-side validation
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (if using backend)
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Session management

---

## 📱 Mobile & Responsive Design

### Current Status
- ✅ Mobile responsive layout
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons
- ✅ Responsive forms
- ✅ Sidebar collapses on mobile

### For Phase 3
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native/Flutter)
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA)
- [ ] Offline-first architecture
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Mobile optimizations

---

## 🌐 Deployment Strategies

### Development
```
localhost:5173 → npm run dev
```

### Staging
```
staging.lifesync.app → npm run build → deploy
```

### Production
```

```

### Recommended CI/CD Pipeline
```
Git Push → GitHub Actions → Lint/Build → Test → Deploy to Staging → Manual Approve → Deploy to Production
```

---

## 📊 Performance Optimization
