# LifeSync Ecosystem Community Hub — Household-to-Neighbourhood Safety and Governance Specification

Version: 2.0
Last Updated: September 14, 2025

This specification defines the comprehensive Community Hub functionality that extends LifeSync ecosystem (LifeSync, Ekhaya, Pigeeback, Family Value, Sazi Academy, BizHelp) from individual safety to structured community resilience through household formation, street federation, and neighbourhood governance.

## Executive Summary

The Community Hub creates a hierarchical safety and governance network: Individual → Family → Unit → Household → Street Community → Neighbourhood. Each level maintains privacy boundaries while enabling rapid emergency escalation and community coordination. The system prioritizes offline-first communications using local Wi-Fi and Bluetooth mesh networks, with internet as secondary connectivity.

## Entity Hierarchy and Core Concepts

### Identity and Grouping Structure

- **Individual**: A person with verified profile bound to one or more devices
- **Family**: A trusted circle within a household (parents, children, relatives, trusted friends)
- **Unit**: A dwelling within a household property (e.g., main house, backyard flat, rental room)
- **Household**: A property boundary hosting one or multiple units and families
- **Street Community**: Households on the same street federated by invitation and validation
- **Neighbourhood**: Multiple streets federated; scalable to areas/wards when needed
- **Community Hub**: The unified interface and backbone connecting all levels

### Roles and Permissions Matrix

| Level | Role | Permissions | Validation Requirements |
|-------|------|-------------|------------------------|
| Household | Admin | Create units, invite members, governance | Bootstrap validator |
| Household | Unit Lead | Manage unit residents, local notices | Validator approval |
| Household | Member | Post notices, respond to alerts | 60% validator approval |
| Household | Minor | Draft posts (requires approval), safety alerts | Guardian + validator approval |
| Street | Coordinator | Street governance, responder roster | Election by member households |
| Street | Moderator | Content moderation, conflict resolution | Election by member households |
| Neighbourhood | District Lead | Cross-street coordination, authority liaison | Election by street coordinators |

Sources of truth: Identity lives at Individual; membership and governance live at Family, Household, Street, Neighbourhood.

## Membership, Validation, and Governance

### Household Creation and Validator Growth

- **Admin Bootstrap**:
  - Create household: Define address, geofence, units, and initial policies.
  - Invite first member: Direct invite by phone/email/QR; admin validates first join.
- **Validator Chain**:
  - Two validators rule: Admin and first validated member co-validate the next join.
  - Growing quorum: Each validated member becomes a validator until the validator pool is established.
  - 60% acceptance rule: New members require approval by at least 60% of current validators.
- **Unit Assignment**:
  - Create units: Name, type (owner-occupied, rental, guest), capacity, and responsible Unit Lead.
  - Assign people: Residents and guests mapped to specific units with unit-level permissions.

### Household Intranet and Controls

- **Intranet Page**: Incidents, notices, shared calendar, tasks, resources, and safety widgets.
- **Privacy Controls**: Family-only, unit-only, household-wide, or public (selective) visibility.
- **Publisher Controls**: Minors and guests can draft but require validator approval for outbound notices.

### Household Governance

- **Constitution**: Lightweight policy set: membership rules, validator thresholds, incident validation rules, escalation boundaries, and role rotation.
- **Elections**: Time-bounded polls to elect Household Admin, Moderators, and Unit Leads.
- **Meetings**: Agenda-driven sessions (text/voice/video based on connectivity), minutes auto-archived.
- **Sanctions**: Graduated responses (warning → mute → temporary suspension → removal), with appeal workflow.

### Street and Neighbourhood Federation

- **Street Invitations**: Any household can invite another household on the same street (address-bound with geofence).
- **Street Validation**:
  - Initial join: First household validates the second.
  - Growing quorum: Subsequent joins require confirmation by existing street validators, using the 60% rule.
- **Street Governance**:
  - Roles: Street Coordinator, Moderators, Responders, Members.
  - Public page: Announcements, safety stats, community projects, contact protocols.
- **Neighbourhood Layer**:
  - Federation: Multiple streets form a neighbourhood; similar validation and governance patterns.
  - Opt-in: Non-participating households retain privacy; participants enjoy full benefits without penalising non-joiners.

## Safety, Alerts, and Validation

### Alert Levels and Actions

| Level | Trigger | Actions | Escalation |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| Info | Routine notices (water outage, power cut) | Local notification, no urgency | None |
| Watch | Potential issues (suspicious activity) | Community alert, confirmation required | 2 confirmations → Warning |
| Warning | Validated threats (confirmed crime, fire) | Responder dispatch, authority notification | 3 confirmations → Emergency |
| Emergency | Life-threatening (medical crisis, active danger) | Full community mobilization, emergency services | Immediate |

### Double-Knock and Multi-Source Validation

- **First Knock**: Initial report from a verified member or device.
- **Second Knock**: Independent confirmation by another member, unit, household, or sensor (e.g., smoke alarm, panic button, camera event).
- **Escalation Logic**:
  - Info → Watch: 2 confirmations within a time window.
  - Watch → Warning: 2+ confirmations from different units/households or 1 sensor + 1 human.
  - Warning → Emergency: 3+ confirmations across distinct sources, or a critical sensor (panic button) + 1 human.
- **Anti-Abuse and Integrity**:
  - Rate limiting: Throttle repeated alerts from same source; stagger re-broadcasts.
  - Reputation signals: Validators and responders accrue trust; false-positive streaks reduce weighting.
  - Auditable trails: Signed event logs with tamper-evident hashes; privacy-respecting redaction on export.
  - Minor Protection: Minors' posts default to "draft" state pending validator review unless whitelisted (e.g., medical alerts).

## Offline-First Communications and Presence

### Connectivity Hierarchy

- **Primary**: Local Wi-Fi LAN, Wi-Fi Direct, and Bluetooth LE for device-to-device mesh.
- **Secondary**: Internet (cellular/broadband) for cross-area sync and cloud archival.
- **Store-and-Forward**: Devices cache messages and sync when peers are in range or online.

### Mesh Messaging and Media Adaptation

- **Content Tiers**:
  - Tier 1 (low): Compressed text, check-ins, presence beacons.
  - Tier 2 (medium): Voice snippets and low-res images.
  - Tier 3 (high): Live voice, then video when bandwidth allows.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Fallback to text; auto-upgrade to richer media when connectivity improves.

### Presence and Reachability

- **Status Badges**:
  - Local: Within household mesh range.
  - Nearby: Within street mesh range.
  - Online: Internet reachable.
  - Unavailable: No peer contact; last-seen timestamp visible per policy.
- **Delivery Semantics**:
  - Guaranteed local delivery: Acked over mesh; retries until confirmed.
  - Deferred cloud sync: Uplinks when any gateway device is online.

### Meetings and Channels

- **Channels**: Family, Unit, Household, Street, Neighbourhood, Responders, and Incident Rooms.
- **Meetings**: Agenda, speakers list, time-boxed slots; auto-generate minutes and tasks; recording when permitted.
- **Proximity Updates**: Administrators can push announcements that propagate via local mesh first, then cloud.

## Data Model, Workflows, and UI

### Key Data Objects

- **Individual**: Identity data, devices, keys, roles.
- **Family**: Members, validators set, policy, channels, public template settings.
- **Unit**: Name, type, residents, Unit Lead, resources.
- **Household**: Address, geofence, units, governance, validators, public page content.
- **Street/Neighbourhood**: Boundaries, member households, validators, governance, public content.
- **Alert**: Type, level, location scope, confirmations, audit hash, escalation state.
- **Message**: Channel, priority, media tier, delivery receipts.
- **Resource**: Tools, skills, vehicles, medical kits; availability schedule.
- **Policy**: Validation rules, thresholds, sanctions, data retention.

### Household Onboarding Flow

1. Create household: Admin defines property, units, and baseline policies.
2. Invite first member: Admin validates the first joiner; both become validators.
3. Invite remaining members: Invites can be sent by admin and validated members; acceptance requires 60% validator approval.
4. Assign units and roles: Map residents to units; set Unit Leads; configure minors/guests.
5. Publish intranet: Enable modules (LifeSync safety widgets, calendar, notices, resources).
6. Optional public page: Admin selects from templates (holistic family profile, professional-facing, minimal, safety-focused, or community service).

### Street Onboarding Flow

1. Propose street community: Household Admin defines street boundary and default policies.
2. Invite peers: Distribute street join invites; first joining household co-validates the next.
3. Validator pool: As households join, validator quorum adopts the 60% rule for new households and policy changes.
4. Street governance: Elect Coordinator/Moderators; enable responders roster; publish public street page.

### UI Highlights

- **Household Intranet**:
  - Header: Address, geofence status, presence summary.
  - Tabs: Incidents, Notices, Calendar, Resources, Units, Members, Governance.
  - Incident Room: Timeline, confirmations, map, responder ETA, tasks, attachments.
- **Public Pages**: Template selector with live preview; granular toggle for which blocks are public.

## Security, Privacy, and Trust

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All personal messaging and alerts; public pages are separately signed and published.
- **Device Binding**: Pair devices with per-device keys; lost device revocation by any two validators or Admin alone.
- **Mutual Authentication**: Household and street membership handshakes require signed challenges.
- **Scoped Disclosure**: Location and health data visible only per policy and role.
- **Key Recovery**: Social recovery via validators quorum; recovery codes stored offline.
- **Safety for Witnesses**: Anonymous tips at street/neighbourhood level with moderator escrow and evidence sealing.
- **Export Controls**: Redacted evidence bundles for authorities with chain-of-custody hashes.

## Platform Integration Map

### LifeSync (Core Safety)

- **Follow Me Home**: Extend to "safety relays" so multiple nearby members can handover tracking.
- **Emergency Sync**: Double-knock validation and radius-based dispatch to responders.
- **Incident Taxonomy**: Crime, fire, medical, utility outages, transport, and social welfare checks.
- **Presence-Aware Routing**: Prefer local responders; fallback to broader layers.

### Ekhaya (Household Management and Governance)

- **Units and Resources**: Manage rentals, shared assets (generators, water tanks), access policies.
- **Governance**: Elections, sanctions, policy proposals and votes at household/street layers.
- **Compliance**: Optional documentation vault (leases, IDs, permits) with selective disclosure.

### Pigeeback (Trust and Transport)

- **Trust Graph**: Community-verified drivers, couriers, and chaperones; badges and incident history.
- **Safe Routing**: Street/neighbourhood safe zones; escort requests; panic integration with LifeSync.
- **Hitchhiking Safety**: Verification rituals, trip beacons, check-ins, and responder auto-alerts.

### Family Value (Formalisation and Public Presence)

- **Family Registry**: Templates for public-facing family pages; professional and service-oriented variants.
- **Mutual Aid**: Care rosters, meal trains, childcare swaps; escalate to street if coverage gaps arise.
- **Skills and Enterprise**: Showcase family skills/services; opt-in directory on street/neighbourhood pages.

### Sazi Academy Integration

- **Curriculum Modules**: Community safety education, governance training, and digital literacy.
- **Skill Certification**: Community responder training, first aid, and conflict resolution courses.
- **Learning Communities**: Street-level study groups and neighbourhood academies.

### BizHelp Integration

- **Business Networking**: Community business directory, service exchanges, and partnership opportunities.
- **Economic Development**: Neighbourhood investment pools, skill-sharing marketplaces.
- **Compliance Support**: Business governance templates and regulatory guidance.

## Operations, Metrics, and Roadmap

### Key Metrics

- **Time to First Response**: Household, street, neighbourhood.
- **Validation Speed**: Median time from first to second knock.
- **False Alarm Rate**: By category and source type.
- **Coverage**: % households on a street; % units configured; presence uptime.
- **Participation**: Meeting attendance, vote turnout, responder availability.
- **Mesh Effectiveness**: Local delivery success, hop count, time-to-sync without internet.

### Edge Cases and Resilience

- **Admin Loss/Unavailability**: Any two validators can appoint an interim Admin; logged and reversible by 60% vote.
- **Membership Disputes**: Temporary suspension pending vote; evidence logged; appeal window.
- **Spoofing Attempts**: Signed messages, device fingerprinting, anomaly alerts to moderators.
- **Power/Connectivity Outages**: Mesh-first propagation; designated gateway devices; solar/UPS prompts.
- **Mass Events**: Rate limiting, priority queues for life-threatening alerts, temporary broadcast channels.

### Implementation Phases

1. **Household Core**: Units, validator workflow, intranet, LifeSync safety widgets, offline mesh basics.
2. **Street Federation**: Invitations, validator quorum, street governance, responders roster, public page.
3. **Neighbourhood Layer**: Cross-street escalation, analytics, partner integrations.
4. **Media and Meetings**: Adaptive voice/video, recording/archival with permissions.
5. **Trust and Transport**: Pigeeback badges, safety relays, trip beacons.
6. **Family Formalisation**: Family Value public templates, mutual aid, skills directory.
7. **Hardening and Scale**: Security reviews, load testing, mesh optimization, disaster drills.

## Developer Handover Essentials

- **Access Control**: Role- and scope-based with policy-driven checks at message publish, alert escalate, and roster actions.
- **Validation Engine**: Configurable quorum calculator with weighted reputations and time windows per layer.
- **Sync Layer**: Pub/sub over mesh with CRDT-based state reconciliation; eventual consistency to cloud.
- **Presence Service**: Local beacons + cloud heartbeat; policy-driven last-seen exposure.
- **Incident Pipeline**: Signed events, confirmation aggregator, escalation rules, dispatcher, audit sink.
- **Template Engine**: Public pages with block-level visibility toggles; signed publish artifacts.
- **Observability**: Local and cloud logs with privacy filters; red-team hooks for chaos drills.

## What This Unlocks

- **Faster, Local-First Response**: Family and neighbours act while authorities are en route.
- **Trust Through Verification**: Human confirmations plus sensors reduce panic and false alarms.
- **Resilient Comms**: Mesh-first design keeps families connected without internet.
- **Dignified Visibility**: Families can present themselves publicly on their own terms.
- **Scalable Governance**: The same validator logic and quorum rules apply from unit to neighbourhood.
