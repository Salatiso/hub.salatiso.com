# LifeSync Ecosystem Architecture Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the centralized architecture for the Salatiso Ecosystem, with LifeSync serving as the central hub for shared features and functionality.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. LifeSync as the Source of Truth
- All core LifeSync features originate and are maintained in the main LifeSync application
- Major updates and new features are developed in LifeSync first
- Other ecosystem apps consume LifeSync features through shared components or APIs

### 2. Shared Component Library
- Core components (ID Verification, Facial Recognition, Safety Features) are maintained in a shared package
- Other apps import these components rather than duplicating functionality
- Ensures consistency and reduces maintenance overhead

### 3. Ecosystem Integration
- All apps maintain links and access to LifeSync features
- Users can seamlessly move between apps while maintaining their LifeSync profile
- Cross-app functionality is preserved through shared authentication and data

## Ecosystem Applications

### Core Applications
1. **LifeSync** - Central hub and source of truth
2. **Ekhaya** - Home services and property management
3. **Family Value** - Family safety and relationship management
4. **HR Help** - Human resources and employment services
5. **BizHelp** - Business assistance and services
6. **SafetyHelp** - Emergency and safety services

### Standalone Applications
1. **PigeeBack** - Independent facial recognition platform (commercialized separately)

## Shared Component Library

### Installation
```bash
# Install shared components in any ecosystem app
npm install @salatiso/lifesync-shared
```

### Usage
```javascript
import { IDVerification, FacialRecognition } from '@salatiso/lifesync-shared';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <IDVerification
      onVerificationComplete={handleVerification}
      context="my-app"
      requireFacial={true}
    />
  );
}
```

## Integration Requirements

### Mandatory LifeSync Links
All ecosystem applications MUST include:

1. **LifeSync Navigation Link**
   - Prominent link to LifeSync in main navigation
   - "Access LifeSync Features" button in key workflows

2. **Cross-App Authentication**
   - Shared authentication system
   - Seamless profile sync between apps

3. **LifeSync Feature Access**
   - Direct links to LifeSync for advanced features
   - Embedded LifeSync components where appropriate

### Critical Integration Points

#### Ekhaya (Home Services)
- **High Priority**: Full LifeSync integration required
- ID verification for service providers
- Facial recognition for property access
- Safety features for home visits
- Link: "Secure with LifeSync" on all service bookings

#### Family Value
- **High Priority**: Full LifeSync integration required
- Family member verification
- Safety monitoring features
- Emergency contact management
- Link: "Family Safety Hub" connecting to LifeSync

#### HR Help
- **High Priority**: Full LifeSync integration required
- Employee verification
- Background checks
- Workplace safety features
- Link: "HR Compliance Suite" in LifeSync

#### BizHelp
- **Medium Priority**: Core LifeSync features
- Business verification
- Service provider checks
- Link: "Business Safety Tools" in LifeSync

#### SafetyHelp
- **Medium Priority**: Core LifeSync features
- Emergency response integration
- Safety verification
- Link: "Emergency Safety Center" in LifeSync

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Component Development
- All new LifeSync features developed in `packages/lifesync-shared`
- Components must be theme-able and configurable
- Include proper TypeScript definitions
- Follow established design patterns

### 2. Version Management
- Use semantic versioning for shared package
- Major updates require ecosystem-wide testing
- Deprecation notices for breaking changes

### 3. Update Process
1. Develop feature in LifeSync
2. Test in LifeSync environment
3. Update shared package
4. Publish new version
5. Update all consuming apps
6. Deploy ecosystem-wide

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for shared components
- Integration tests for each consuming app
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Cross-browser and mobile testing

## API Integration

### Shared Endpoints
```
POST /api/lifesync/verify-id
POST /api/lifesync/facial-recognition
GET  /api/lifesync/user-profile
POST /api/lifesync/safety-sync
```

### Authentication
- Shared Firebase authentication
- Cross-app session management
- Secure token exchange

## Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. **LifeSync Updates**: Deploy to production first
2. **Shared Package**: Publish to NPM
3. **Consumer Apps**: Update dependencies and deploy
4. **Verification**: Test integrations across ecosystem

### Rollback Plan
- Version pinning for stability
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Emergency rollback procedures

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Component usage across apps
- Feature adoption rates
- Cross-app user journeys
- Performance and error rates

### Logging
- Centralized logging for shared components
- User journey tracking
- Error reporting and alerting

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Shared components handle sensitive data
- Encryption standards across all apps
- GDPR and POPIA compliance
- Secure data transmission

### Access Control
- Role-based feature access
- App-specific permissions
- Audit trails for sensitive operations

## Future Expansion

### New Applications
1. Follow the established pattern
2. Integrate with shared components
3. Include mandatory LifeSync links
4. Test cross-app functionality

### Feature Development
1. Assess if feature belongs in shared library
2. Develop in LifeSync first
3. Extract to shared package if reusable
4. Update consuming apps

## Support and Documentation

### Developer Resources
- Shared component documentation
- API reference guides
- Integration tutorials
- Code examples and templates

### Maintenance
- Regular updates to shared package
- Security patches and bug fixes
- Performance optimizations
- Feature enhancements

## Contact and Governance

### Architecture Decisions
- LifeSync team leads major architectural changes
- Ecosystem apps provide input and requirements
- Regular architecture review meetings

### Issue Resolution
- Shared component issues: LifeSync team
- App-specific issues: Respective app teams
- Cross-app issues: Ecosystem coordination
