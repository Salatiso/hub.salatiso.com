import { FollowMeHome, SafetyWidget } from '@salatiso/lifesync-sdk';

function ParentPortal({ studentId }) {
  return (
    <div className="parent-portal">
      <FollowMeHome 
        targetUserId={studentId}
        monitoringType="parental"
        alertPreferences={{
          schoolArrival: true,
          schoolDeparture: true,
          emergencyAlerts: true,
          routeDeviation: true
        }}
      />
      <SafetyWidget 
        features={['student-safety', 'transport-monitoring']}
        userRole="parent"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Student Transport Safety
```javascript
// School transport verification
const transportSafety = {
  driverVerification: true,
  vehicleTracking: true,
  studentCheckIn: true,
  emergencyProtocols: true,
  parentalNotifications: true
};
```

### 3. Staff Verification
```javascript
// Staff background verification
const staffVerification = {
  idValidation: true,
  backgroundCheck: true,
  trustScoring: true,
  safetyClearance: true
};
```
