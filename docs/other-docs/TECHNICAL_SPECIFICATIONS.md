# LifeSync: Technical Specifications

**Document ID:** LIFESYNC-SPEC-V4.1  
**Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Status:** Production Deployed with Full Safety Ecosystem & Shared Library Integration  
**Live Application:** https://lifesync-lifecv.web.app

## 1. Core Philosophy & Mission

LifeSync is the connective tissue of the Salatiso Ecosystem. It is not merely a "dating app" or a "business networking tool"; it is a sophisticated compatibility and relationship management platform built on the ecosystem's core principles of **user sovereignty, holistic value recognition, privacy by design, and comprehensive safety.**

Its mission is to facilitate secure, consent-based connections between individuals for various life contexts (Romance, Business, Friendship, Kinship), enabling them to understand compatibility and build stronger relationships through a process of mutual, controlled self-revelation, while providing enterprise-grade safety and community management features.

## 2. The Guest-First Architecture: "Solo Experience & Guest Sync"

LifeSync is architected to provide immense value upfront, building trust and demonstrating the ecosystem's power without requiring user registration.

### 2.1. The Anonymous "Solo Experience"

- **No Login Required:** Any user can access core features immediately upon visiting the site.
- **Truncated "Guest LifeCV":** Users can populate a temporary, browser-based profile with non-personally identifiable information relevant to the four sync contexts.
- **Engaging Questionnaires:** Users can answer dynamic, context-aware questionnaires. A minimum of 10 questions in a chosen category is required to initiate a sync. The questions are designed to be a mix of logical, emotional, and fun prompts to encourage honest self-revelation.

### 2.2. The 7-Day Renewable "Guest Sync"

- **Full Functionality:** When a user initiates a sync, they and their partner get the full, un-crippled LifeSync experience. This includes detailed compatibility reports and access to all assessment tools.
- **Frictionless Guest Pass:** Initiating a sync automatically creates a temporary, anonymous user profile (e.g., via Firebase Anonymous Auth) that persists for 7 days.
- **The "Magic Link":** A unique, one-time-use "sync link" is generated to connect the two guest users securely.
- **The Generous Loop:** The 7-day guest session can be renewed up to **5 times**. All data is preserved with each renewal. This provides up to 35 days of full, free access, giving users ample time to experience the platform's value. After the final renewal, the primary call-to-action becomes creating a permanent Hub account.

### 2.3. The Sovereign Exit: Data Portability & Privacy

- **Data Takeout:** If a guest user chooses not to create a permanent account, they are offered a "Data Takeout" option. Their entire Guest LifeCV and all questionnaire answers are packaged into a portable format (e.g., a JSON file or a QR code containing the data).
- **30-Day Grace Period:** The user can use this file/QR code to restore their session if they return within 30 days.
- **Guaranteed Deletion:** After 30 days of inactivity, all temporary guest data is permanently and irretrievably deleted from the system, fulfilling our non-negotiable commitment to data privacy.

## 3. Core Features & Functionality

### 3.1. Multi-Context Compatibility Engine

LifeSync supports four distinct compatibility contexts:

- **Romance:** Assesses values, communication styles, life goals, and relationship expectations.
- **Business:** Assesses skills, work styles, risk tolerance, and strategic alignment. Enables a "Public Sync Profile" for service providers in the BizHub marketplace, allowing for one-way compatibility checks.
- **Friendship:** Assesses social preferences, hobbies, communication styles, and core interests.
- **Kinship:** A unique feature designed to help users discover potential family links. It uses non-identifying ancestral data (e.g., clan names, birthplaces of ancestors). Positive matches are handled with extreme care, requiring mutual consent to reveal overlapping data points. This feature directly integrates with the philosophy of the `FamilyValue` module.
