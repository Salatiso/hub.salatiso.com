# Salatiso Community Governance & Hub Framework
## Terms of Reciprocity for Community-Driven Ecosystem Stewardship

### Vision Statement
The Salatiso ecosystem operates on the principle of **community reciprocity** - where every member, from individual to neighborhood, contributes to maintaining the quality, accuracy, and integrity of our shared digital commons. This framework establishes a decentralized governance system that empowers community members to collectively steward content across all Salatiso platforms while building resilient local networks that function independently yet remain interconnected.

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Hierarchical Community Autonomy
- Communities self-organize from individual → family → household → street → neighborhood levels
- Each level maintains local governance while contributing to ecosystem-wide standards
- Decisions flow organically through community tiers, not from centralized control
- Local offline networks provide resilience and accessibility regardless of internet connectivity

### 1.2 Progressive Responsibility Through Community Investment
- Increased platform privileges come with demonstrated community investment
- Contributors earn stewardship roles through validated engagement at multiple community levels
- The system rewards those who build both local and ecosystem-wide value

### 1.3 Resilient Network Architecture
- Primary communication via local WiFi and Bluetooth networks
- Internet serves as secondary connection method for extended reach
- Offline-first design ensures functionality during connectivity disruptions
- Local validation and governance continue independently of central systems

## Conclusion

This integrated Community Governance & Hub Framework creates a comprehensive system that builds from individual families to neighborhood-level communities while maintaining the original ecosystem-wide content moderation capabilities. The framework prioritizes local resilience through offline-first design while enabling broader ecosystem coordination and growth.

By integrating household formation, local network optimization, and progressive community building with robust content governance, we create a system that empowers communities to be self-sufficient while remaining connected to the broader Salatiso ecosystem vision.

The framework ensures that whether internet is available or not, communities can continue to function, communicate, and govern themselves while contributing to and benefiting from the larger ecosystem of services and resources.
