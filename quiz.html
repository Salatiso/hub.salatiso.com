                    <p>Molweni! Welcome to The Hub by Salatiso and the wider Ecosystem. We're excited to have you on board. Before you dive in, please take a moment to read our terms. It won't take long I promise.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6">1. The Spirit of Our Agreement</h3>
                    <p>Think of this as a partnership. We're providing you with powerful tools for free during this testing period. In return, we ask for your honest feedback to help us improve. We're building this for you, and with you.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6">2. The Beta Testing Period</h3>
                    <p>All the tools and services across The Hub and our ecosystem websites are currently in a <strong class="text-yellow-400">free testing period</strong> until further notice. This means you get full access without any cost. We're doing this because we believe in the value of our tools and we want to build the best possible product with your help.</p>
                    <p>Future subscription and payment models will be announced well in advance and will have free tiers, so if you never want to pay you never have to. For now, your currency is your time and your valuable feedback.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6">3. Your Responsibility (This is Important)</h3>
                    <p>Our tools use advanced AI to help you generate documents, plans, and other content. While we strive for accuracy and usefulness, the output is generated by a human machine combination. AI is a powerful assistant, but it's not a substitute for personal accountability, informal and professional advice (legal, financial, etc.); your own judgment is alwaysbetetr than you think because you are the one who will live wit the consequences.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>You are fully responsible</strong> for how you use the tools and the content you generate.</li>
                        <li>Always review, edit, and verify any output before you use it for any real-world purpose.</li>
                        <li>You agree not to use the tools for any illegal, harmful, or malicious activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By using our services, you agree to hold The Hub by Salatiso, its ecosystem partners, holding and associated entities harmless from any liability or loss arising from your use of the content generated by our tools.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6">4. Your Data and Privacy</h3>
                    <p>We respect your privacy. We collect data to improve our services and personalize your experience. We will never sell your personal data. Please review our full Privacy Policy for more details.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6">5. Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Your feedback is gold to us. We encourage you to share your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter. This helps us make the platform better for everyone.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6">6. Changes to Terms</h3>
                    <p>We may update these terms as our services evolve. We'll notify you of any significant changes. Continuing to use the service after changes means you accept the new terms.</p>

                    <p class="mt-8">By clicking "Accept," you are agreeing to these terms and confirming you understand your responsibilities as a user of our beta platform.</p>
